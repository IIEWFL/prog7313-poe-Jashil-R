we have come across a big problem as we were working on the project. we tried running the project and also making a new document and transferring files to the new document, but the problem was that the errors of the documents started to say that the gradle files were corrupt and was running multiple gradle documents. when we created a new project and tried to run it the emulator had started to fail and the app had refused to run. we tried to clean and rebuild the document but unfortunately the documents rebuild option had randomly disappeared.  we are not sure what to do about it or either what had happened, but we wrote this just to let know what happened and have included screenshots. we were using the virtual machine.
